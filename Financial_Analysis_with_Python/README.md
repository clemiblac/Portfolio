Financial Analysis with Python

* For this project I created a Python script that analyzes financial records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


  *  The main script is in 'main.py`. 
  *  The "Resources" folder contains the CSV files used for the analysis.
  *  The dataset in the CSV file is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`
  *  The "analysis" folder the contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.
