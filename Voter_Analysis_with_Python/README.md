* In this challenge, I wrote a program to count votes from an election.

*I used a set of poll data called [election_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.


  *  The main script is in 'main.py`. 
  *  The "Resources" folder contains the CSV files used for the analysis.
  * The "analysis" folder the contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.
