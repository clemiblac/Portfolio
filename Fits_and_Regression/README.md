In this project I used Scipy to fit FBI CIUS (Crime in the United States 20*) data and Matplotlib to display the fit.

* I generated a scatter plot with Matplotlib using the year as the independent (*x*) variable and the violent crime rate as the dependent (*y*) variable.

*I used `stats.linregress` to perform a linear regression with the year as the independent variable (*x*) and the violent crime rate as the dependent variable (*y*).

*I used the information returned by `stats.linregress` to create the equation of a line from the model.

* I calculated the predicted violent crime rate of the linear model using the year as the *x* values.

* I plotted the linear model of year versus violent crime rate on top of your scatter plot.

* I repeated the process of generating a scatter plot, calculating the linear regression model, and plotting the regression line over the scatter plot for the following pairs of variables:

  * Year versus murder rate.

  * Year versus aggravated assault.

* I then used the regression lines you created to predict what the violent crime rate, murder rate, and assault rate will be in 20*.
